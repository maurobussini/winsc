Inside folder **sample** you will find a sample of Windows Service created using .NET Framework 4.7.2. In order to try "winsc" please **build** the .NET application (using Visual Studio 2017/2019).

The Windows Service executable file will be generated in 
*.\sample\SampleWindowsService\SampleWindowsService\bin\Debug\SampleWindowsService.exe*. Please check its existence before proceed.

Then run with **administrative privileges** from the project **root** folder the following commands on console.

For install the new service:

```console
node ./sample/sample-install.js install
```

For uninstall the service, run the following command:

```console
node ./sample/sample-install.js uninstall
